# Agtube ðŸŽž

Agtube means literally Agnes + Youtube.
I built a this website that using Youtube Open API.
It can select the darkmode and see the list and detail pages, related videos, also can search as keyword.

I used `flex` layout for responsive and `@apply` of TailwindCSS for easier maintenance.
