# Agtube ðŸŽž

Agtube means literally Agnes + Youtube.
I built this website with Youtube Open API.
You can select the darkmode and see the list and detail pages, related videos, and also can search by keywords.

I used `flex` layout for a responsive and `@apply` of TailwindCSS for an easy maintenance.

You can see [Agtube](https://agtube.netlify.app/).

## # Installation

In the project directory, you can run:

- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open `http://localhost:3000` to view it in your browser.
